\sec Transportation problems

The problem as described in the chapter \ref[chap:motivation] is an instance of transportation problems. As described in \cite[Helmert2003], 
we can expect that this problem is NP-complete.

\secc Capacitated vehicle routing problem

As described in \cite[Dantzig1959], the capacitated vehicle routing problem (cVRP, originally The Truck Dispatching Problem) may be defined as follows:

\begitems \style N
* Given a set of $n$ ``station points'' $P_i\, (i = 1, 2, \dots, n)$, to which deliveries are made from point $P_0$, called the ``terminal'' 
* A ``Distance Matrix'' $[D] = [d_{ij}]$ is given which specifies the distance $d_{ij} = d_{ji}$ between every pair of points $(i,j = 0, 1, \dots, n)$.
* A ``Delivery Vector'' $(Q) = (q_i)$ is given which specifies the amount $q_i$ to be delivered to every point $P_i\, (i=1,2,\dots,n)$.
* The truck capacity is $C$, where $C > {\rm max}\,q_i$.
* If $x_{ij} = x_{ji} = 1$ is interpreted to mean that points $P_i$ and $P_j$ are paired $(i,j = 0,1,\dots,n)$ and if $x_{ij} = x_{ji} = 0$ means that the points are not paired, one
obtains the condition
$$\sum_{j=0}^n{x_{ij}} = 1\quad (i=1,2,\dots,n)$$
since every point $P_i$ is either connected with $P_0$ or at most one other point $P_j$. Furthermore, by definition, $x_{ii} = 0$ for every $i = 0, 1, \dots, n$.
* The problem is to find those values of $x_{ij}$  which make the total distance
$$D = \sum_{i,j=0}^{n}{d_{ij}x_{ij}}$$
a miniumum under the conditions specified in 2) to 5).

\secc Vehicle routing problem as a job scheduling problem

In \cite[Beck2002] the VRP is reformulated as an scheduling problem. However, these reformulations have not a same performance. As described in \cite[Beck2003], in an optimisation task
the VRP is better in minimising of the total travelled distance whereas the scheduling technology is better in finding the quickest solution. In the existence task was the VRP itself
significantly worse than scheduling technology. Though, the VRP technology can be used to improve results of the scheduling technology.
