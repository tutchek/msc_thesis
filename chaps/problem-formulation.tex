\chap Problem formulation

The problem as described in the chapter \ref[chap:motivation] can be stated as follows:

\begitems \style N
* Given a set of $n$ ``stores'' $S_i\, (i = 1, 2, \dots, n)$, representing the stores which contains the goods.
* A set of $m$ ``goods'' $G_i\, (i = 1, 2, \dots, m)$ is given, 
* An ``on stock matrix'' $M_{ij}\, (i = 1, 2, \dots, |S|; j = 1, 2, \dots, |G|)$ is given which specifies the amount of the goods $j$ available in the store $i$.
* An ``on stock matrix'' $M_{ij}\, (i = 1, 2, \dots, |S|; j = 1, 2, \dots, |G|)$ is given which specifies the amount of the goods $j$ in the store $i$.
